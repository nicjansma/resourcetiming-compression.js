## Introduction

`resourcetiming-compression.js` compresses data from [ResourceTiming](http://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing/).  A
companion script, `resourcetiming-decompression.js`, converts the compressed data back to the original form.

[ResourceTiming](http://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing/) is a W3C web-perf API that exposes all of the page's resources' network timing information to the
developer and is available in most [modern browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=resource-timing).  The interface
`performance.getEntriesByType('resource')` returns a list of resources with information about each resource's URL, why it was downloaded, and
a dozen timestamps.  Collecting this information is easy, but beaconing all of this data back to a data warehouse can
be a challenge because of the amount of data available for each resource.  On a typical page, which might have over
100 resources, you could easily see 50 KB of ResourceTiming data per page-load.

`resourcetiming-compression.js` applies several data-compression techniques to reduce the size of your serialized
ResourceTiming data to about 15% of it's original size in many cases.  See
[this nicj.net blog post](http://nicj.net/compressing-resourcetiming/) for a description of these techniques.

`resourcetiming-decompression.js` is a companion script that will take the compressed ResourceTiming data and
builds it back to its original ResourceTiming form (eg. `performance.getEntriesByType('resource')`) for analysis.

NOTE: `resourcetiming-compression.js` is the same code that drives the `restiming.js` plugin for
[Boomerang](https://github.com/lognormal/boomerang/), but also includes the `resourcetiming-decompression.js` component.

## Usage

Please see the [W3C ResourceTiming API Reference](http://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing/) for details on how to use the
ResourceTiming API.

### resourcetiming-compression.js

To include resourcetiming-compression.js, simply include it via a script tag:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="resourcetiming-compression.min.js"></script>
```

Once included in the page, a top-level `ResourceTimingCompression` object is available on `window`.  If AMD or CommonJS environments are detected, it will simply expose itself via those methods.

From the NPM module:
```js
var ResourceTimingCompression = require("resourcetiming-compression").ResourceTimingCompression;
```

To get all of the compressed resources, you can simply call:

```js
var {restiming, servertiming} = ResourceTimingCompression.getResourceTiming();
```

### resourcetiming-decompression.js

To include resourcetiming-decompression.js, simply include it via a script tag:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="resourcetiming-decompression.min.js"></script>
```

Once included in the page, a top-level `ResourceTimingDecompression` object is available on `window`.  If AMD or CommonJS environments are detected, it will simply expose itself via those methods.

From the NPM module:
```js
var ResourceTimingDecompression = require("resourcetiming-compression").ResourceTimingDecompression;
```
To decompress your resources, you can simply call:

```js
var original = ResourceTimingDecompression.decompressResources(restiming, servertiming);
```

## Resource Dimensions

If available, when [compressing the resources](http://nicj.net/compressing-resourcetiming/) via `compressResourceTiming()`, any resource that has a visible component on the page (such as an `IMG` element) will have its `height` `width` `top` and `left` values captured and included in the compressed data as well.

This information is encoded as a "special value" in the resource's timings array.

For each resource, multiple hits to the same URL are separated by a pipe (`|`) character:

```
{
  // this resource was loaded twice with timings 70,1z,1c and 90,1,2
  "http://blah.com/js/foo.js": "370,1z,1c|390,1,2"
}
```

(See the [blog post](http://nicj.net/compressing-resourcetiming/) for a description of how to interpret the values)

If the resource has visible elements on the page, they will be appended to this list of timings with a special prefix of `*0` ([Base36](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base36) encoded):

```
{
  // this resource was loaded twice with timings 70,1z,1c and 90,1,2 and had
  // dimensions of height = 1, width = 5, top = 10 and left = 11
  "http://blah.com/js/foo.js": "370,1z,1c|390,1,2|*01,5,a,b"
}
```

## Resource Sizes

If available via [ResourceTiming2](https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing/), when [compressing the resources](http://nicj.net/compressing-resourcetiming/) via `compressResourceTiming()`, the resource's `transferSize`, `encodedBodySize` and `decodedBodySize` will be captured and included in the compressed data as well.

This information is encoded as a "special value" in the resource's timings array.  They will be appended to the list of timings with a special prefix of `*1`:

The data will be stored in the order of: `[e, t, d]`.

* `e`: `encodedBodySize` is the [Base36](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base36) decoded value (`encodedBodySize = parseInt(e, 36)`)
* `t`:
    * If a Base36 encoded number, `t` is the `transferSize` increase in size over `encodedBodySize` (`transferSize = parseInt(e, 36) + parseInt(t, 36)`)
    * If the value of `"_"`, `transferSize` is `0`
    * If missing, `transferSize` was either `0` or `undefined`
* `d`:
    * If a Base36 encoded number, `d` is the `decodedBodySize` increase in size over `encodedBodySize` (`decodedBodySize = parseInt(e, 36) + parseInt(d, 36)`)
    * If `0`, `encodedBodySize` is `0`
    * If missing, `encodedBodySize` was either `0` or `undefined`

Taking the following example:

```
{
  // this resource was loaded twice with timings 70,1z,1c and 90,1,2 and had
  // transferSize
  "http://blah.com/js/foo.js": "370,1z,1c|390,1,2|*1a,b,c"
}
```

Results in:

* `encodedBodySize` = `parseInt("a", 36)` = `10`
* `transferSize` = `parseInt("a", 36) + parseInt("b", 36)` = `21`
* `decodedBodySize` = `parseInt("a", 36) + parseInt("c", 36)` = `22`

## Resource Contributions

We call contribution of a resource to a page the proportion of the total load time that can be blamed on that resource.
We want contribution scores to encourage parallelization and not only short resources.

It enables us to study resource impact in a more meaningful way over simply looking at raw load times.

Here is an example with only 2 resources to get some intuition into how it works:

```
    0                                        100ms
A   |-----------------------------------------|

                      50ms                   100ms
B                      |----------------------|
```

The contribution of resource A is 50ms for the 0-50ms time range and 50ms/2 for the 50ms to 100ms time range because
it overlaps with B. We get:

`contribution_A = (50 + 50 / 2) / 100 = .75`

`contribution_B = (50 / 2) / 100 = .25`

This is computed based on all the resources in a single beacon. It is not done by default because it is computationally
expensive.

Here is a code example to add contributions to your own resources:

```js
var original = ResourceTimingDecompression.decompressResources(rtData);
// "original" is now an array of resource timings.

ResourceTimingDecompression.addContribution(original);
// Resources in "original" now have a field "contribution".
```

## Server Timing
Server Timing entries are included on Resource- and NavigationTiming entries as `serverTiming`. They must have a `name`, _might_ have a non-empty `description`, and will likely have a non-zero `duration`. This compression is build on the presumption that resources will have server timing entries with unique `duration`s pointing mostly to the same `name` and `description`s. There are two parts to this compression:

1. A "lookup" data structure containing all of the unique `name` and `description` pairs (an array of arrays, sorted with most-common first)
2. For each resource timing entry, a list of duration and key pairs, where duration is the `duration` of the server timing entry and the key maps to the name and description in (1)

Take the following example:
```javascript
performance.getEntriesByName(<path/to/resource1>)[0].serverTiming === [{
  name: 'm1',
  duration: 1,
  description: 'desc1'
}, {
  name: 'm2',
  duration: 2,
  description: 'desc3'
}]

performance.getEntriesByName(<path/to/resource2>)[0].serverTiming === [{
  name: 'm1',
  duration: 3,
  description: 'desc1'
}, {
  name: 'm1',
  duration: 4,
  description: 'desc2'
}]

```

* `getResourceTiming()` will return a `servertiming` "lookup" will all of the unique pairs of name and description, equal to:

    `[[m1, desc1, desc2], [m2, desc3]]`

* We supplement the compressed resource timing data with comma-separated list of the form: `<duration>:<entryIndex>.<descriptionIndex>`.
    * For "resource1", we add: `1:0.0,2:1.0`
    * For "resource2", we add: `3:0.0,4:0.1`

* To save bytes, we will omit the zeroes, and irrelevant separators. So, from our example:
    * For "resource1", we add: `1,2:1`
    * For "resource2", we add: `3,4:.1`

* And lastly, were there only one `description` for a given `name` and it was empty-string, then we simplify that array entry:

    `[["description1", ""], ...]` would become `["description1", ...]`
